<h1>Deep Q-Learning for Lunar Landing</h1>

 

<h2>Description</h2>

<br />
This project aims to develop an AI agent capable of autonomously landing a lunar module in a simulated environment using Deep Q-Learning (DQN).
<br />
The agent learns optimal landing strategies by interacting with the environment, balancing fuel usage, and minimizing landing speed.



<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Python: Core programming language.</b>
- <b>Gymnasium (LunarLander-v2): Simulation environment for training the agent.</b>
- <b>PyTorch: Deep learning framework used to implement and train the DQN model.</b>
- <b>Deep Q-Learning (DQN): Reinforcement learning algorithm that combines Q-learning with deep neural networks for decision-making.</b>


<h2>Objective</h2>

- <b>Train an AI agent to perform safe and efficient lunar landings by optimizing its actions through reinforcement learning.</b> 
- <b>The project demonstrates the application of AI in solving complex control problems in a simulated space environment.</b>
